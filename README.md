A bioinformatics pipeline for searching and recruiting protein sequences from large databases. Currently consists of a main nextflow script "main.nf" which implements 2 different methods for enzyme discovery with InterproScan and Hmmer software packages
by calling 2 nextflow scripts from the workflows folder. Several modules are used to handle the data derived from the main processes, including easier to read outputs, summary of results, and .fasta formats for the next steps of the analysis.
