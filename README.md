# Thesis
A bioinformatics pipeline for searching and recruiting protein sequences from large databases
Currently consists of a main nextflow script "test-1.nf" which implements 2 python scripts:
"Seqs_Separator.py" for splitting aggregated fasta files into smaller chunks and
"fisherman.py" for detecting query interpro domains from tsv output files of the interproscan software package
